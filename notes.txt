0. move notification core into library
    - get it to take parameters
1. get little stub exe that can call the core
    - get params from command line
2. rename things (no spaces, shorter name)
3. generate new app process (see notes in build.ts)

add note to readme explaining why the build is run with TypeScript (lol)
    - OR port it to Python -- looks like fonttools can unpack a ttc file; can we rasterize easily though? TBD.
